# TicTacToe-GUI
This program displays a resizeable 5x5 Tic Tac Toe game.  Play alternates between two players, who play 0 and X.
Playing rules are same as a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game.
After the game ends the program displays a dialog box announcing the winner.
If the game ends as a draw a dialog box pops up with the draw message.

At the top of the screen there's a menu bar with the items 'New Game' and 'Quit'.
Clicking 'New Game' will reset the board to start a new game.
Clicking 'Quit' will exit and close the game window.
